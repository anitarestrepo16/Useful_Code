# filter: use criteria to decide which rows to include
flights2013b <- flights %>% filter(year == 2013) # criterion to filter is that year = 2013, pass flights into filter function
# filter function note: unlike base subset with [,], rows where the condition = NA are dropped

# select: select specific variables from matrix object
flightYearMonth <- flights %>% select(year, month)

# filter and select at the same time
flightYearMonth2013 <- flights %>% filter(month == 1) %>% select(year, month) # can chain different functions

# pull: This works like [[ for local data frames, and automatically collects before indexing for remote data tables

# mutate: adds new variables and preserves existing ones
flights <- flights %>% mutate(winterQ = month < 4)

# transmute: adds new variables and drops existing ones
